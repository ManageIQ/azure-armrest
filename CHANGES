= 0.9.1 - 9-Oct-2017
* Fixed an issue where hash properties that contain a '$' sign would fail
  when we attempted to convert them to model objects. They are now converted
  to underscores.

= 0.9.0 - 6-Oct-2017
* Bump nokogiri to at least 1.8.1 to avoid security warnings.
* Adds the 'skip_attribute_definitions' flag on all azure armrest models. This
  allows us to significantly reduce memory and increase speed within internal
  methods that generate lots of intermediate objects. Thanks go to Nick LaMuro
  for this work.

= 0.8.4 - 2-Oct-2017
* Logging bug fix in StorageAccount#all_blobs method.
* Modified the StorageAccountService#list_all_private_image method. It now
  automatically skips over containers labeled "bootdiagnostics".
* Relaxed the nokogiri dependency in the gemspec because of incessant CVE's.
* Updated the parallel gem dependency.
* The ResourceGroupBasedService#get_by_id method is now case insensitive.

= 0.8.3 - 22-Sep-2017
* Most underlying requests will now automatically retry in certain
  circumstances. Specifically, 409, 429 and most 50x errors will now
  sleep and retry three times (by default) before giving up since
  these errors are usually transient.
* Fixed an error handling bug in the StorageAccount#all_blobs method.
* Added the Configuration#max_retry accessor.
* Added the ArmrestCollection#next_link method (part of refactoring).
* The ArmrestService#wait method now takes an optional interval parameter.
* Refactored the ManagedStorageHelper#get_blob_raw method. It now does a better
  job of waiting for, and releasing, the lock on the file.
* Some refactoring for speed, memory and the removal of duplicate code. Thanks
  go to Nick LaMuro for the patches.
* General refactoring of the StorageAccountService class with regards to
  passing configuration information.

= 0.8.2 - 30-Aug-2017
* The :list and :list_all methods for the ResourceProviderService class now
  accepts a filter.
* The :list_all method for the TemplateDeploymentService class now accepts
  a filter.
* The get_blob_raw method was refactored into a module that both the
  Storage::SnapshotService and Storage::DiskService classes now mixin.
  Thanks go to Jerry Keselman for the PR.
* Added the :exists? method to the ResourceGroupService class.
* Added the :exists? method to the TemplateDeploymentService class.
* The filter for private image collection now ignores case. This addresses
  an issue where private images would not be picked up for regions
  within Canada or India.
* Added the KeyVaultService class.
* The :create method in any ResourceGroupBasedService class will now
  automatically camelize hash keys for you.

= 0.8.1 - 4-Aug-2017
* Fixed a bug in the DiskService#get_blob_raw method that affected you if you
  used :start_byte + :length options. Thanks go to Jerry Keselman for the spot.
* The :filter option for ResourceGroupBaseService#list_all now ignores case
  when testing against string values.

= 0.8.0 - 20-Jul-2017
* The StorageAccount#create_blob and StorageAccount#create_blob_snapshot methods
  were heavily revamped and now return a ResponseHeaders object.
* Added support for storage file services to the Storage model, so you can
  now create, delete or query files or directories on storage accounts.
* Added the list_all instance method to the VirtualMachineImageService class.
  Thanks go to Tyler Gregory for the patch.
* Added the ArmestService#list_locations method. This returns an array of
  Location objects. The ArmrestService#locations method still returns just
  an array of strings, but is now deprecated.
* The StorageAccount#all_blobs method now accepts an options argument.

= 0.7.5 - 27-Jun-2017
* Added the ContainerService service class.
* Added the StorageAccount#access_key accessor. If set, this is now used as
  the default since "properties.key1" is no longer supported by Azure.
* Added predefined Environment's for China and Germany.
* The nokogiri dependency was updated to 1.7.2.

= 0.7.4 - 9-Jun-2017
* Added the BaseModel#subscription_id method.
* Improved the underlying regex for BaseModel#resource_group.
* Added the StorageAccount#update_blob_properties method.
* The object returned by StorageAccountService#list_private_images now
  includes the resource_group.
* The default storage_api_version was updated to 2016-05-31.

= 0.7.3 - 11-May-2017
* Added guards against ECONNREFUSED and TimeoutException for the
  StorageAccountService#get_private_images and StorageAccount#all_blobs
  methods. These errors are sporadic and could cause some of our inner
  looping methods to fail. Consequently, they are now just logged with
  a warning and skipped.

= 0.7.2 - 26-Apr-2017
* Added the Storage::DiskService#get_blob_raw method. This is similar to the
  StorageAccount#get_blob_raw method, but works for managed disks.
* Added the :managed_disk?, :size (alias :flavor) and :operating_system
  (alias :os) methods to the VirtualMachine model for convenience.

= 0.7.1 - 11-Apr-2017
* Fixed a bug in the BaseModel#to_json method. It now handles arrays of
  model objects properly.
* Updated the Nokogiri dependency to 1.7.x due to a CVE.

= 0.7.0 - 24-Mar-2017
* Altered the TemplateDeploymentService#get_template method to only return
  a plain JSON string instead of a model object. The previous approach was
  doomed to fail eventually given the less structured nature of templates.
* Minor buff to our dynamic model creation, as it will now handle spaces
  in key names. We thought the .underscore method already did this (it doesn't).
* Added the Storage::DiskService, Storage::ImageService and
  Storage::SnapshotService service classes. These all relate to managed disks.
* Some spec cleanup for the logger tests which were failing on Windows.
* Updates to our test matrix, including the addition of Ruby 2.4.0.

= 0.6.1 - 28-Feb-2017
* Replaced the cache_method gem with the memoist gem because cache_method was
  causing problems when this gem was used within a Rails app. Thanks go to
  Jason Frey for spotting the issue and the patch. This change is mostly
  seamless, but it does mean that the ResourceProviderService methods are
  no longer cached for only 24 hours.

= 0.6.0 - 6-Jan-2017
* Revamped the Role::AssignmentService and Role::DefinitionService which were
  mostly broken. These are now each subclassed from a RoleService base class
  that implements various scope-based methods.
* The Insights::MetricsService class was updated to add the list_metrics and
  list_definitions methods. These use the newer API from Azure that is easier
  to use, but returns fewer definitions.
* Added the ResourceProviderService#registered? method.
* Some rubocop updates.

= 0.5.2 - 22-Dec-2016
* The Configuration#hash method, which is used internally to cache auth
  tokens, was modified to include the environment name. This prevents
  conflicts for apps in mixed environments.

= 0.5.1 - 21-Dec-2016
* The Configuration#subscription_id= method does not validate or fetch
  provider information if the argument is nil or blank.

= 0.5.0 - 20-Dec-2016
* Added the Azure::Armrest::Environment class. The Configuration#environment
  option now takes an Environment instance. There are two predefined instances
  that you can use - Public or USGovernment. The default is Public.
* Fixed bugs caused by altering the base_url. This affected the tags and
  tenants methods, as well as the VirtualMachineService#series method.

= 0.4.2 - 19-Dec-2016
* Added the delete_by_id method, so you can now delete by ID string.
* Added the TemplateDeploymentService#delete_associated_resources method.

= 0.4.1 - 16-Dec-2016
* The Configuration#environment accessor was added. As of this release you
  can specify 'usgov' as an option to the constructor, and the appropriate
  resource and authority endpoints will be used instead of the public ones.
* Added the #authority_url and #resource_url accessors to the Configuration
  class. Use wisely.
* The Armrest::COMMON constant was removed because the resource isn't actually
  constant. Instead use the authority_url or resource_url methods. This was
  really only meant for internal use anyway.
* Added the Armrest::USGOV_RESOURCE and Armrest::USGOV_AUTHORITY constants.
* Fixed a bug in the VirtualMachineService#delete_associated_resources where
  the method would fail if you requested network security group deletion but
  there was no associated network security group.
* Fixed an issue in the ArmrestService#poll method where a 202 response might
  not actually have a body. In that case, it is treated as success.
* Fixed a logic bug in the ArmrestService#wait method, and added the option
  to specify 0 (infinity) for the wait time.
* Added the ArmrestService#log method, and the Configuration.log= method now
  automatically converts the argument to a Logger instance if it's not already.
* The ArmrestService#base_url method was altered to include subscription
  information.

= 0.4.0 - 8-Dec-2016
* The Configuration constructor no longer requires a subscription ID. However,
  the presence of a subscription ID is still required for almost all Service
  classes. The verification now happens later, within the Service constructor.
* Added the SubscriptionService class. This does not require a subscription ID
  in advance, so you can get a list of subscriptions for a tenant.
* The Configuration#subscription_id= and Configuration#proxy= writer methods
  now have custom implementations.

= 0.3.13 - 30-Nov-2016
* Fixed the Billing::Usage model class name.
* Updated the Billing::Usage#list method so that it returns an ArmrestCollection
  instead of a plain array. In addition, it now supports an :all option so
  that you don't have to deal with continuation tokens.

= 0.3.12 - 15-Nov-2016
* Added the Insights::DiagnosticService class.
* Added the get_from_vm and get_os_disk methods to StorageAccountService.
* Added the delete_associated_resources method to VirtualMachineService.
* The output of StorageAccount#blob_properties method now includes the blob
  name and the container name.
* Added a service_name accessor to the ArmrestService base class.
* The list_all method in StorageAccountService now supports a filter.

= 0.3.11 - 8-Nov-2016
* Fixed the regex for the internal method parse_id_string, making the
  get_associated_resource method more robust.
* The get_associated_resource now supports VM extensions.
* The list and list_all methods for the ResourceService class now
  optionally return all possible results instead of capping at 1000.
* Some updates for codeclimate-test-reporter, simplecov.

= 0.3.10 - 28-Oct-2016
* Added the ResourceGroupBasedService#get_associated_resource method. This
  method will retrieve a service or subservice resource based on an ID string.

= 0.3.9 - 19-Oct-2016
* The StorageAccount#delete_blob method now returns a ResponseHeaders object
  instead of true.
* The Configuration.clear_caches method now additionally clears the
  CacheMethod config store.

= 0.3.8 - 7-Oct-2-16
* Added more robust exception wrapping, now mostly based on http error code.
* Refactored the internal fetch_providers method so that it uses our own
  service class method call, which is cached.
* Added the TemplateDeploymentService#get_template method.
* The :list and :list_all methods in the ResourceGroupBasedService class now
  automatically perform pagination.
* Replaced our custom inspect with the one provided by pretty_print.
* Added the :response_code and :response_headers accessors to the BaseModel
  class. All individual objects and collections now set these.
* Modified our :poll method to check the :response_code, and to try the
  :location attribute if :azure_asyncoperation isn't found.
* Updated the :create documentation for the StorageAccountService class.

= 0.3.7 - 15-Sep-2016
* Modified the private image listing code in the StorageAccountService class
  to skip over storage accounts when we cannot get a key.

= 0.3.6 - 13-Sep-2016
* Added the poll and wait methods to the ArmrestService base class. These
  are meant for use with asynchronous operations, e.g. create and delete.
* All methods that returned a plain array now return an ArmrestCollection
  object instead. This is a subclass of Array, but includes header and
  skip token information.
* Added the ArmrestCollection.create_from_response method. This creates
  and returns a collection based on a JSON response and a model type.
* Minor update to the ApiException#to_s method so that includes a bit
  more information.

= 0.3.5 - 11-Aug-2016
* When we added subscription ID validation in 0.3.2 we forgot to set proxy
  information first. That has been fixed.

= 0.3.4 - 9-Aug-2016
* Modified the StorageAccount#blobs and StorageAccount#containers method. Both
  now accept a hash of options that you can use to modify the results. Also,
  both now automatically handle continuation tokens to collect all results.
* The ResourceGroupBasedService#delete method now returns a ResponseHeaders
  object instead of nil. Furthermore, it will raise an error on a 204 response
  which indicates that the resource wasn't actually found.
* Added the Network::LoadBalancerService and Network::InboundNatService classes.
* Added the Network::RouteService and Network::RouteTableService classes.

= 0.3.3 - 1-Aug-2016
* Added the :max_threads configuration option. This is used internally wherever
  the Parallel gem is used.
* The default number of threads when used with VCR is reduced to 1.

= 0.3.2 - 21-Jul-2016
* The subscription ID is now automatically validated in the
  Azure::Armrest::Configuration constructor.
* Added a Hakiri badge to the README.
* There have been some minor updates to the dependencies to enforce
  more recent versions of external gems, as suggested by Hakiri,
  for security reasons.
* The ResourceGroupBasedService#list_all method (and all subclasses)
  now supports an optional hash that can be used to automatically
  filter result sets.

= 0.3.1 - 14-Jul-2016
* Now uses the parallel gem and thread pools for those few methods where
  we were using threaded methods internally in order to reduce errors
  caused by too many requests.
* Updated the rest-client dependency to 2.0.0 now that it has been released.
* Updated travis.yml to only test 2.2.5 and 2.3.1 for now. Partly due to a
  change in the activesupport gem.
* One rspec fix for 2.3.x.

= 0.3.0 - 28-Jun-2016
* The configuration handling has been moved into its own class called
  Azure::Armrest::Configuration. You can call this explicitly using :new,
  or you can still use ArmrestService.configure.
* The :subscription_id option for configuration is no longer optional.
  The logic for automatically fetching the first active subscription ID
  that could be found has been dropped.
* Added the Billing::UsageService class.
* Added a TooManyRequests exception.
* Added support for pretty_print.
* Added the addressable gem as a dependency, as it internally replaces
  the uri standard library. Calls to rest-client are still encoded, but
  now using Addressable::URI.
* StorageAccountService no longer does account type validation.
* Added the StorageAccountService#list_all_private_images method.

= 0.2.10 - 15-Sep-2016
* Backported PR #213 (skip over storage accounts that don't have keys).

= 0.2.9 - 25-Aug-2016
* Backported PR #211 (exception class updates and specs).

= 0.2.8 - 22-Jul-2016
* Backported PR #188 (add list_all_private_images method).
* Backported PR #194 (updated .travis.yml).

= 0.2.7 - 20-Jun-2016
* All internal calls to rest-client are now explicitly URI.encoded.

= 0.2.6 - 9-May-2016
* If no subscription is provided, the internal method for fetching a default
  subscription ID will now skip over tenant/subscription mismatches.
* Removed the hard-coded api-version string for both TemplateDeploymentService
  and StorageAccountService.
* Because there was an underlying REST API change for storage account keys for
  api-version strings set at 2016-01-01 or later, the list_account_key_objects
  and regenerate_account_key_objects methods were added. These return model
  objects instead of plain hashes. The list_account_keys and regenerate_account_keys
  methods still behave as before.

= 0.2.5 - 11-Apr-2016
* Fixed a bug in the custom exception handler where the error code and
  message were not set properly.

= 0.2.4 - 4-Apr-2016
* The ArmrestCollection#skip_token method was renamed to "continuation_token".
* Added the ArmrestService.log and ArmrestService.log= methods. These are just
  thin wrappers around RestClient.log and RestClient.log= methods.
* Fixed the StorageAccount#table_data method, and added support for
  continuation tokens.
* Fixed a bug in the BaseModel's method generation code where an all-caps
  key would create strange results.
* Dealt with a bug in the StorageAccountService#create method caused by
  a potentially empty response.

= 0.2.3 - 29-Mar-2016
* Fixed the VirtualMachineImageService class.
* Added an Insights::MetricsService class and support models.
* Added a singleton method to clear some internal class variable caches that
  we use. This is primarily meant for testing.
* Added a customs collection class that will eventually be used for better
  handling of skip tokens (paging).
* Updated the Insights::Event class, modifying the list method's prototype,
  and now it returns our custom collection class.

= 0.2.2 - 16-Mar-2016
* Fixed a potential name collision issue for nested objects.

= 0.2.1 - 15-Mar-2016
* The ssl_version and ssl_verify options are now supported by, and
  automatically passed on to, StorageAccount model objects.
* Added the get_blob_raw method to get at raw blob data. Use wisely.
* Nested model objects are now named based on the attribute name rather
  than anonymous.

= 0.2.0 - 10-Mar-2016
* The Armrest.configure method now supports the :ssl_verify and :ssl_version
  options. By default, the ssl_version option is set to TLSv1 instead of
  using older defaults used by Ruby's net-http library.

= 0.1.3 - 7-Mar-2016
* StorageAccount model objects now have their proxy value automatically
  set to whatever the proxy was set to in the configuration argument
  for StorageAccountService.

= 0.1.2 - 2-Mar-2016
* When selecting the appropriate api version string, we now reject dates
  that are ahead of the current date.
* Some minor rubocop cleanup.

= 0.1.1 - 26-Feb-2016
* Added proxy support for both the storage model and main configure method.
* Added the SqlDatabaseService and SqlServerService classes.
* Added the ResourceGroupBaseedSubservice abstract base class.
* When fetching a default subscription, enabled subscriptions are chosen
  before disabled subscriptions. If only a disabled subscription can be
  found then a warning is issued.
* You can now create blobs and blob snapshots with the storage model.
  Thanks go to Alexandre Lamandé and Nguyễn Tấn Tài and for their patches.
* Some internal refactoring to use our own helper methods for various
  RestClient methods, and other cleanup.

= 0.1.0 - 26-Jan-2015
* Refactored the ArmrestService class api_version and provider handling.
* The ArmrestService class no longer uses "preview" api versions by default.
* Added RBAC service classes.

= 0.0.9 - 17-Dec-2015
* Added AlertService and EventService classes.
* Added tables, table_info and table_data methods to the StorageAccount model.
* Updates to the README.

= 0.0.8 - 10-Nov-2015
* Added the list_private_images method to the StorageAccountService class.
* Added the list_all method to the ResourceGroupService class.
* Removed the EventService class for now. It did not actually work, and will
  eventually be re-implemented as part of a group of Insights classes.
* Added a .to_h and .to_hash method for the BaseModel class.

= 0.0.7 - 5-Nov-2015
* Refactored our BaseModel class so that it no longer uses Delegate or OpenStruct.
* Added more methods to the StorageAccount model, and modified methods so that
  any options are always the last argument.
* Bug fix for the StorageAccount#all_blobs method.

= 0.0.6 - 23-Oct-2015
* Defined a custom == method for the BaseModel class.
* The TemplateDeployment#properties.outputs now returns a hash.
* Temporarily use a BaseModel hash ref instead of a method name due to name
  collision with ManageIQ until a general solution is worked out.

= 0.0.5 - 21-Oct-2015
* The VirtualMachineService#series method now returns VirtualMachineSize
  objects instead of a raw hash.
* Fixed a bug in the Network::IpAddress::Service class.
* Cleaned up some spec warnings.

= 0.0.4 - 19-Oct-2015
* All get/list/list_all methods now return wrapper class instances, e.g.
  a call to VirtualMachineService#get will return a VirtualMachine instance.
  These provide a nice OpenStruct wrapper so you can use methods instead
  of hash references if desired.
* A custom StorageAccount class was added that implements methods for
  gathering blob information.
* Most service classes now inherit from ResourceGroupBasedService, which
  provides a common set of methods typically used for various services.
* Now re-raises RestClient exceptions as exceptions that we have defined.
* The VirtualMachineImage class was overhauled and is now working properly.
* The azure-signature, nokogiri and activesupport dependencies were added.

= 0.0.3 - 13-Oct-2015
* Bug fixes for VirtualMachineImageService class.
* Reorganized and updated SubnetService class.
* Some updates to the BaseModel in prep for JSON wrapper classes.
* Added NetworkSecurityGroupService and IpAddressService classes.

= 0.0.2 - 23-Sep-2015
* Revamped class names. Now use "Service" instead of "Manager".
* Several new service classes added, updated, and refactored.
* All service classes now take and store configuration information as the
  first argument to ensure distinct credentials.
* Added Bill Wei as author.

= 0.0.1 - 13-Aug-2015
* Initial release
